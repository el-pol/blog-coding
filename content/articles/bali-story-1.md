> It was August 29 2016 when I first landed in Bali. Almost 2 years have passed since that moment.



## Time flies


That's all I can think about right now. It seems like yesterday when I first set foot in the Island Of The Gods. In the end, this place has given me a lot of energy, happiness and perspective.

But, first, a little origin story:


## Before Bali

I decided to enroll in the [Darmasiswa Program](http://darmasiswa.kemdikbud.go.id/) because I was not happy with my life in Barcelona. In my last year of university, I decided to move with two friends to a flat in the center of Barcelona. At that moment I had two jobs: in the mornings a marketing internship and in the afternoons I was an accountant for an advertising studio (a start-up).

I was *a 100% in the system*.

I finished my degree (Business Management) and was working like a dog and partying like crazy in the weekends. What sounded like a dream (moving from a small town to Barcelona with my best friends), ended up making me quite depressed an needing for something else.

Looking back, I vividly remember sitting at a table with a group of friends and listening to their conversation. They looked so happy with their lives, and I felt so bored and uninspired by everything they said or did. The topics didn't interest me, I got tired of meeting the same people who talk about the same over and over. I was longing for **something more exciting.**

> I felt really out of place. Mentally, especially.

I did not like my jobs, my friends kind of bored me (and I bored them, sure) and the circles I was getting into were not my thing.

Without knowing it, I was restless to look for something else. Something different. The straight path was not for me.

## Enter Mr. Alberto "Bapak" Garcia

I owe this person a lot. At that point in time, he was my best friend's older brother. I knew that he was playing some weird instrument in Bali. He was basically, **enjoying life in paradise.**

When he finished from Bali and came back to Barcelona, we started talking. He was so happy, speaking wonders of Bali and the balinese people. I could see the fire in his eyes of **someone who also doesn't like the *straight path* of working 8h a day in an office**. Like me, he spent some time of exchange in The Netherlands. He finished his studies but was not convinced of what was next.

By then, I was sure I had to go. It felt right. Alberto helped me with my application. After a lot of paperwork and a Skype interview, I just had to wait. It was difficult, because in Spain, all the 10 applicants wanted to go to Bali.

But luck was on my side. I got the email from the Indonesian Consulate: **I was the chosen one**. I was the only Spaniard accepted to Bali in 2016. I could not believe it. I was scared and excited at the same time.

## The pursuit of happiness

That is what I was chasing when I left for Bali: to find myself, to be happy.

It sounds silly. I used to be one of those people that when I heard someone say that they were going to Asia to *find themselves*, I always rolled my eyes. That sounded so naive and typical. But you know what? Two years laters, I realize that was exactly what I did without realizing it. And yes, **it worked**.

I chose to study Bahasa Indonesia. I thought it would always help to learn a new language and it would be better to connect with the Indonesian people.

From the moment I set foot in Bali, it felt like home. I was **so happy**. And all my future classmates who I met during the first days were feeling the same. Most of them were also looking for *the meaning of life* and what to do next.

We were all looking for a time off from our realities in the Western world.

In general, everyone was happy living life. Enjoying the days and learning a new language in a place really close to paradise. What else could we want?

> I still remember waking up every morning, opening the door, and saying to each one of my housemates: **WE ARE IN BALI!!!!!**

We all smiled and joked around with how blessed we were about that chance that was given to us by the Darmasiswa Program.

## Cultural shocks

Of course we had our problems and differences with people. But if there is something I love from Indonesian people, it is **how easy it is for them to accept circumstances and move on without complaining too much.**

In the Western world, we are complaining *all the time*. Or at least I felt like this. Even in Bali, you can hear some tourists or expats complaining always. Indonesian people complaining? Not that much.

Also, people here **smile much more easily**. In Europe, 80% of times you smile at random people, they will think you are weird or that you want something from them (or both).

So, Indonesian society may be well behind in many things (sexism, for example), but they have some more **humane qualities** that seem lost in Europe.
